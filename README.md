IALA - CALMAR
=============

Mooring Line Calculation Software

Appreciating that AtoN buoy mooring lines are often dimensioned with a rule of thumb and regularly end up as being too short for most site conditions, IALA has developed an easy to use numerical catenary mooring line calculator, derived from their own mooring calculators.
This tool integrates a few more load parameters than IALA guidelines and other simple calculators.
This tool allows users to use or input libraries of buoy models or easily built their own buoy model for calculation.
It also allows user to compare the results between two different buoys or two different buoys mooring lines. 
This software will be offered for free distribution to IALA members.
